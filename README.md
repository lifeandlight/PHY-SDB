PHY-SDB: A Dual-Physics-Guided Deep Learning Framework for Hyperspectral Satellite-Derived Bathymetry


This is the complete code that can be run directly, provided that the user has prepared all the inputs, 
including 
 hyperspectral imagery, 
water depth data, 
IOP data, 
and model parameters, to run the code. Detailed processing steps can be found in the paper.
