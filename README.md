# PHY-SDB
PHY-SDB: A Dual-Physics-Guided Deep Learning Framework for Hyperspectral Satellite-Derived Bathymetry

This is the complete code that can be run directly, provided that the user has prepared all the inputs, 
including 
hyperspectral imagery, 
water depth data, 
IOP data, 
and model parameters, to run the code. Detailed processing steps can be found in the paper.

The repository currently includes: 
1. Full implementation of the FC-DNN and CNN-1D models
2. The dual-physics-guided (PHY-SDB) framework, including IOP feature input and physics-consistency loss
3. Complete training, validation, and predict image scripts

The required input data for the code can be downloaded from the following public link：
