PHY-SDB: A Dual-Physics-Guided Deep Learning Framework for Hyperspectral Satellite-Derived Bathymetry


This is the complete code that can be run directly, provided that the user has prepared all the inputs, 
including 
1 hyperspectral imagery, 
2 water depth data, 
3 IOP data, 
4 and model parameters, to run the code. Detailed processing steps can be found in the paper.
